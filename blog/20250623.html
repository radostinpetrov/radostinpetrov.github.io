The city of cities. I was able to visit it finally in the last few weeks and it was amazing. A long dream for me, to walk the streets that I have only heard the names of on TV, or to see the lifestyle I have only heard of. What is the energy that New York has?</p>
<p><img src="/new_york_skyline.JPG" alt="New York Skyline"></p>
<h3>1. The people</h3>
<p>New York wouldn't be the city it is without its people. It sounds a bit cliche but the energy inbetween the tall concrete buildings comes from the people. If you want to know what is so different about them: it's that they are all misplaced out of their comfort zone and are only there for the incredible opportunity the city provides.</p>
<p>However, this also has downsides. And you can see them as soon as you go to a place widely crossed by yankees - the subway. Since most people are mostly transplanted in New York, they don't care for the city to be pleasant for living. They are working 14 hours a day, why would they care for anything besides their home and work places to be tidy? Social responsibility is low in a place that people know they will eventually leave. It is a harsh place to live in and even harsher to raise a family. Also, big shoutout to NYPD, seeing them everywhere really is a top New York tourist experience.</p>
<p>Yet, New Yorkers have impeccable energy and drive. That is in a sense, natural selection - you either adapt to the city's demands or you die. People are racing to cut 1 minute off of their commute. Eating in delis and at food trucks. Nothing says New York, like swallowing a big pizza pie slice on the sidewalk. Which brings me to...</p>
<h3>2. The Food</h3>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 100px;">
<img src="/pizza_on_the_side_walk.JPG" alt="New York Slice, Baby!" width="200"/>
<img src="/diner.JPG" alt="Classic American Diner" width="400"/>
</div>
<p>When I first planned my New York trip, I knew exactly what food I wanted to try - bagels, pizza, deli pastrami, diner food. And, boy, did New York deliver. Starting the day off with a massive (and massively oily) corned beef bagel, stopping for a New York slice for lunch in West Village (shoutout NYU) and then wrapping it all with a dinner at a diner. I couldn't imagine a better day of big city eating. A nice surprise was the variety and high quality of Mexican food that I had. Sadly no pictures of that.</p>
<div style="display: flex; gap:50px;">
<img src="/bagels.JPG" alt="bagel" width="300">
<img src="/pastrami.JPG" alt="Katz's Deli was very touristy" width="350">
</div>
<p>I think this is something that foreign tourists who only visit New York as part of the United States overlook. The traditional, non-chain, street and deli food, as opposed to famous fast food chains that you can find at every corner in the city. Best places that I had food are <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6sdXSy48iSWA26M9A">Leo's Bagels</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yZEYe24S5892Wx5PA">L'Industrie</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RvGFaAV6s67gRkWf7">Los Tacos No.1</a> - a chain but nevertheless great tacos, and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/sRH9f6pGtyqYvLU79">Prince Street Pizza</a> for the best pizza I have ever had (Spicy Vodka! - see below).</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center">
<img src="/pizza_pie.JPG" alt="Spicy Vodka" width="400">
</div>
<p>If you are visiting New York I suggest you slim down first and prepare for a cheat week that will go in the books. All of the above were absolutely delicious and absolutely could trigger a heart attack if you are not careful.</p>
<h3>3. The streets</h3>
<p>New York wouldn't be New York without the fire escapes at the side of buildings. Truly a paradise for an urban enthusiast. You have (in particular order of my liking) SoHo, West Village, Tribeca, Financial District, Midtown, Upper East Side, Chinatown - all very iconic areas in the heard of Manhattan, each with its own landmark and absolutely different vibe than the rest. Rarely you can go to a city that feels both small and residential and also big and business-driven. And that is just Manhattan. At the top of my list actually is Brooklyn, specifically, Brooklyn Heights, Dumbo and Williamsburg.</p>
<p><img src="/fire_escapes.JPG" alt="Fire Escapes are a big New York thing"></p>
<p>My time was split between Manhattan and Brooklyn as I was staying in the place that connects both - the Financial District. FinDi itself was a pleasant surprise as it is one of the oldest areas of New York and the buildings had a nice gothic touch to them, especially in the colour being a dimmer brown or olive gray. Additionally, FinDi had some of the best food places I tried, as they are catering more to the working population that is running around Wall Street all day.</p>
<p>Walking through these neighborhoods, what struck me most was how the city never repeats itself. Every block felt like it had its own rhythm — a unique mix of noise, smell, people, and architecture. The layering of time is visible: old brownstones next to sleek glass towers, cobblestone streets leading to scaffolding-covered skyscrapers. Fire escapes, water towers, neon signs, trash bags — all part of the same chaotic harmony.</p>
<p>New York is the only place (maybe bar Tokyo) I’ve been where standing on a random street corner feels cinematic. You don’t have to go looking for landmarks; the streets themselves are the attraction.</p>
<h3>4.Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>New York lived up to the myth. It’s loud, it’s aggressive, and yet somehow charming in a way no other city is. It’s a place that forces you to keep up, to observe, to adapt. There’s beauty in the cracks and chaos. It’s not for everyone, and maybe that’s why it works.</p>
<p>For me, this trip was more than just sightseeing — it was a crash course in modern life, ambition, culture, and human energy. I left the city more tired than I arrived, but also fuller. Of ideas. Of impressions. Of stories.</p>
<p>I’ll be back.</p>
