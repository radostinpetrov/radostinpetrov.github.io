New York. The city of cities. I was able to visit it finally in the last few weeks and it was amazing. A long dream for me, to walk the streets that I have only heard the names of on TV, or to see the lifestyle I have only heard of. What is the energy that New York has?

### 1. The people
New York wouldn't be the city it is without its people. It sounds a bit cliche but the energy inbetween the tall concrete buildings comes from the people. If you want to know what is so different about them: it's that they are all misplaced out of their comfort zone and are only there for the incredible opportunity the city provides.

However, this also has downsides. And you can see them as soon as you go to a place widely crossed by yankees - the subway. Since most people are mostly transplanted in New York, they don't care for the city to be pleasant for living. They are working 14 hours a day, why would they care for anything besides their home and work places to be tidy? Social responsibility is low in a place that people know they will eventually leave. It is a harsh place to live in and even harsher to raise a family. Also, big shoutout to NYPD, seeing them everywhere really is a top New York tourist experience.

Yet, New Yorkers have impeccable energy and drive. That is in a sense, natural selection - you either adapt to the city's demands or you die. People are racing to cut 1 minute off of their commute. Eating in delis and at food trucks. Nothing says New York, like swallowing a big pizza pie slice on the sidewalk. Which brings me to...

### 2. The Food

When I first planned my New York trip, I knew exactly what food I wanted to try - bagels, pizza, deli pastrami, diner food. And, boy, did New York deliver. Starting the day off with a massive (and massively oily) corned beef bagel, stopping for a New York slice for lunch in West Village (shoutout NYU) and then wrapping it all with a dinner at a diner. I couldn't imagine a better day of big city eating. A nice surprise was the variety and high quality of Mexican food that I had. Sadly no pictures of that.

I think this is something that foreign tourists who only visit New York as part of the United States overlook. The traditional, non-chain, street and deli food, as opposed to famous fast food chains that you can find at every corner in the city. Best places that I had food are [Leo's Bagels](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6sdXSy48iSWA26M9A), [L'Industrie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yZEYe24S5892Wx5PA), [Los Tacos No.1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RvGFaAV6s67gRkWf7) - a chain but nevertheless great tacos, and [Prince Street Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sRH9f6pGtyqYvLU79) for the best pizza I have ever had (Spicy Vodka! - see below).

If you are visiting New York I suggest you slim down first and prepare for a cheat week that will go in the books. All of the above were absolutely delicious and absolutely could trigger a heart attack if you are not careful.

### 3. The streets

New York wouldn't be New York without the fire escapes at the side of buildings. Truly a paradise for an urban enthusiast. You have (in particular order of my liking) SoHo, West Village, Tribeca, Financial District, Midtown, Upper East Side, Chinatown - all very iconic areas in the heard of Manhattan, each with its own landmark and absolutely different vibe than the rest. Rarely you can go to a city that feels both small and residential and also big and business-driven. And that is just Manhattan. At the top of my list actually is Brooklyn, specifically, Brooklyn Heights, Dumbo and Williamsburg.

My time was split between Manhattan and Brooklyn as I was staying in the place that connects both - the Financial District. FinDi itself was a pleasant surprise as it is one of the oldest areas of New York and the buildings had a nice gothic touch to them, especially in the colour being a dimmer brown or olive gray. Additionally, FinDi had some of the best food places I tried, as they are catering more to the working population that is running around Wall Street all day. 

Walking through these neighborhoods, what struck me most was how the city never repeats itself. Every block felt like it had its own rhythm — a unique mix of noise, smell, people, and architecture. The layering of time is visible: old brownstones next to sleek glass towers, cobblestone streets leading to scaffolding-covered skyscrapers. Fire escapes, water towers, neon signs, trash bags — all part of the same chaotic harmony.

New York is the only place (maybe bar Tokyo) I’ve been where standing on a random street corner feels cinematic. You don’t have to go looking for landmarks; the streets themselves are the attraction.


### 4.Final Thoughts

New York lived up to the myth. It’s loud, it’s aggressive, and yet somehow charming in a way no other city is. It’s a place that forces you to keep up, to observe, to adapt. There’s beauty in the cracks and chaos. It’s not for everyone, and maybe that’s why it works.

For me, this trip was more than just sightseeing — it was a crash course in modern life, ambition, culture, and human energy. I left the city more tired than I arrived, but also fuller. Of ideas. Of impressions. Of stories.

I’ll be back.
