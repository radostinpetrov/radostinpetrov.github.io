New York. The city of cities. I was able to visit it finally in the last few weeks and it was amazing. A long dream for me, to walk the streets that I have only heard the names of on TV, or to see the lifestyle I have only heard of. What is the energy that New York has?

### 1. The people
New York wouldn't be the city it is without its people. It sounds a bit cliche but the energy inbetween the tall concrete buildings comes from the people. If you want to know what is so different about them: it's that they are all misplaced out of their comfort zone and are only there for the incredible opportunity the city provides.

However, this also has downsides. And you can see them as soon as you go to a place widely crossed by yankees - the subway. Since most people are mostly transplanted in New York, they don't care for the city to be pleasant for living. They are working 14 hours a day, why would they care for anything besides their home and work places to be tidy? Social responsibility is low in a place that people know they will eventually leave. It is a harsh place to live in and even harsher to raise a family.

Yet, New Yorkers have impeccable energy and drive. That is in a sense, natural selection - you either adapt to the city's demands or you die. People are racing to cut 1 minute off of their commute. Eating in delis and at food trucks. Nothing says New York, like swallowing a big pizza pie slice on the sidewalk. Which brings me to...

### 2. The Food
